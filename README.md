## Why?
Well, why not? Assist was created from the culmination of different ideas from many different individuals over a few months. Assist was made to replace the VALORANT icon on your desktop and become a hub for all VALORANT players. Assist brings a plethora of features that make your life easier and better with everything at a few click strokes away. Assist does not replace the Riot Client, The Riot Client continues to Download, Patch, Authenticate and Launch you into the game. Assist is made to be an extension launcher that is separate but together to create a better launcher for players.

## Features
  * Dashboard
    - Taking from the original dashboard we have revamped it. Now it gives you a bit of an insight into your day in VALORANT at a glance. Containing your Missions, your recent stats, and the latest news.
  * Account Switcher
    - Allows you to add accounts to assist, allowing you to hotswap between accounts and launch Valorant without having to login everytime.
  * Store
    - You can now check your store without having to load up the game now, simply click on the store tab and look at your store!
  * LIVE
    - LIVE allows you to view your Live Game and all of it's details.
  * Modules
    - Modules are smaller programs/features that can be enabled/disabled depending on if you want to use it. Including Discord Rich Presense and a Dodge List 0_0
  * Much More!
    - We are always adding new features to make this the best program possible.
